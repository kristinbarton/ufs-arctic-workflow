This is for generating mesh needed to run UFS with MOM6 based on existing MOM6 Grid files.

To generate a mesh:

1. Copy all files to your working directory

2. Check your required files: 
    * This requires an `ocean_mask.nc` file containing longitude and latitude variables 
        `x(ny,nx)` and `y(ny,nx)`, respectively. 
    * If you have these variables but with different names, edit the `gen_scrip.ncl` file 
        lines 42 and 48 to the correct variable names.
    * If your mask file does not contain any center coordinates, add them from the 
        `ocean_hgrid.nc` file by running the python script `add_center_coords.py`

2. Edit `mesh_gen_job.sh` as needed, then run the code: `sbatch mesh_gen_job.sh`
